Hi, I'm Raphael Elspas and I'm _curious about everything_. I've built weather satellites systems at NASA, reverse engineered hardware protocols at Northrop Grumman, and designed wargame simulations at the John's Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. I always wanted to share my love of learning and inspire others to find their inner curiosity, so I decided to become a teacher. Right now I'm an adjunct [professor at UMBC](teaching), and an [engineer at APL](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-elspas-1ba0a34a). Leading informal education opportunities and inventing clever ways of teaching are at the heart of my passions and I hope to forever impact each of my students to help them discover what they can do best.
